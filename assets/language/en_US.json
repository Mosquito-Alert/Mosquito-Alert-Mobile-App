The first four are invasive species in Europe, while the common mosquito is autochthonous. \n\nThis guide will help you identify them.",
    "gallery_info_02": "To identify mosquitoes, you need to know that their bodies are divided into three parts: (A) head, (B) thorax and (C) abdomen. The thorax, which is like the mosquitoâ€™s back, has a pattern that helps us distinguish various species. The leg markings also help, especially those on the third pair (3). The abdomen is also helpful to a lesser extent.",
    "gallery_info_03": "The common mosquito (Culex pipiens): this one bites mainly at night. It is yellowish or pale brown.",
    "gallery_info_04": "The other 4 mosquitoes we are looking for are in the genus Aedes, species that have recently invaded Europe. They are dark or black with white marks and usually bite during the day, including dawn and dusk. Two species have a white pattern on the thorax, while the other two have a golden one.\n\nContinue learning to distinguish these four species.",
    "gallery_info_05": "Tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus): Black with white lines and spots. It has a single white line on the head and thorax. Yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti): Dark brown with white spots and lines. It has a lyre-shaped pattern on its thorax. In all cases this thorax pattern is white.",
    "gallery_info_06": "Aedes japonicus and Aedes koreicus have a golden pattern on their thorax and they are very similar. To distinguish them you have to focus on their legs, specifically on the markings of the third leg pair. Aedes koreicus has a pair of white marks on the final segment of this leg pair, which do not appear in Aedes japonicus.",
    "gallery_info_07": "Mosquitoes have a complex life cycle, with four stages: (1) adult females lay (2) eggs in containers of stagnant water; in several days (3) larvae emerge into the aquatic environment and develop into (4) pupae. The pupae metamorphosize into adults. They can complete the whole cycle in one week. One female can lay hundreds of eggs. Remember: without stagnant water there are no mosquitoes.",
    "gallery_info_08": "Clutch of mosquito eggs from the Aedes genus. The females lay eggs on the dry walls of small containers, just above the stagnant water. The eggs are so small that they are difficult to see with the naked eye. Below, larvae (elongated) and pupae (rounded) of Aedes mosquitoes.",
    "gallery_info_09": "The larvae are aquatic and quickly transform into pupae and then adults through the process known as metamorphosis. In the adult phase, the male and female mosquitoes can be distinguished by the feather-like appendages on their heads. A male tiger mosquito is shown here on the left and a female on the right.",
    "gallery_info_10": "In urban public spaces, sewers are an important breeding ground for many of these mosquitoes. They can also take advantage of tree holes, tree bases, ponds or places on public roads where puddles occur.",
    "gallery_info_11": "In private spaces, Aedes mosquitoes can take advantage of any small container with water in order to develop. This includes plant pot saucers that collect excess water, buckets, or toys in the garden that filll with rainwater. To prevent mosquitoes at home, it is necessary to monitor the spaces and objects where water can accumulate.",

The first four are invasive species in Europe, while the common mosquito is autochthonous.",
    "tutorial_info_03": "You do not need to have experience with mosquitoes, but you should know a few things: The thorax is the part of the body found behind the head of the mosquito. It is like the back. Every species has its own particular pattern on the head and thorax (1) which can be used to identify the five species we are looking for.",
    "tutorial_info_04": "These mosquitoes breed in small containers of stagnant water, such as storm drains, plant pot saucers, sprinklers, holesâ€¦ These are the places where they lay eggs and in which the larvae develop in an aquatic environment. They can complete the whole cycle in one week. Remember: without stagnant water there are no mosquitoes.",
